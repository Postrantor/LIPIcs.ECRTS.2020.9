#  1 Introduction

> industry \[[10](#_bookmark47), [11](#_bookmark48), [12](#_bookmark49),
> [21](#_bookmark58), [39](#_bookmark76)\] for more than a decade.
> Nowadays, Linux has an extensive set of real-time related features,

> mode, Linux developers have extensively reworked the Linux kernel to
> reduce the code sections that could delay the scheduling of the
> highest-priority thread, leading to the well-known PREEMPT\_RT
> variant. cyclictest is the primary tool adopted in the evaluation of
> the fully-preemptive mode of PREEMPT\_RT Linux \[[8](#_bookmark45)\],
> and it is used to compute the time difference between the expected
> activation time and the actual start of execution of a high-priority
> thread running on a CPU. By configuring the measurement thread with
> the highest priority and running a background taskset to generate
> disturbance,
>
> cyclictest is used in practice to measure the *scheduling latency* of

> range from a few microseconds on single-CPU systems to 250
> microseconds on non-uniform memory access systems
> \[[35](#_bookmark72)\], which are acceptable values for a vast range

>
> requirements. This way, PREEMPT\_RT Linux closely fulfills theoretical
> fully-preemptive system assumptions that consider atomic scheduling
> operations with negligible overheads.
>
> Despite its practical approach and the contributions to the current
> state-of-art of real-time Linux, cyclictest has some known
> limitations. The main one arises from the opaque nature of the latency
> value provided by cyclictest \[[4](#_bookmark41)\]. Indeed, it only
> informs about the latency value, without providing insights on its
> root causes. The tracing features of the kernel are often applied by
> developers to help in the investigation. However, the usage of tracing
> is not enough to resolve the problem: the tracing overhead can easily
> mask the real sources of latency, and the excessive amount of data
> often drives the developer to conjunctures that are not the actual
> cause of the problem. For these reasons, the debug of a latency spike
> on Linux generally takes a reasonable amount of hours of very
> specialized resources.
>
> A common approach in the real-time systems theory is the
> categorization of a system as a set of independent variables and
> equations that describe its integrated timing behavior. However, the

# Linux Execution Contexts, Scheduling Dynamics, and Tracing

> With the PREEMPT\_RT patchset, Linux has four different preemption
> models for kernel space activities. This paper targets the
> fully-preemptive mode, in which there are three different execution
> contexts: non-maskable interrupts (NMI), maskable interrupts (IRQs),
> and threads \[[20](#_bookmark57)\]. Both NMIs and IRQs are
> asynchronous interrupts, i.e., mechanisms used to deliver events
> coming either from external hardware or by code running on other CPUs
> via inter-processor interrupts. The interrupt controller manages
> interrupts, both queueing and dispatching one NMI per-CPU and multiple
> IRQs. For each CPU, the NMI is the highest-priority interrupt, so it
> postpones and preempts IRQs. As a design choice, Linux (in the
> fully-preemptive mode) handles IRQs with IRQs disabled. Hence an IRQ
> cannot preempt another IRQ. Threads have no control over the NMI, but
> they can delay the execution of IRQs by temporarily disabling
> (masking) them.
>
> Given the potential interference on the execution of threads, one of
> the design goals of PREEMPT\_RT was to reduce the code executing in
> interrupt context to the bare minimum, by moving most of it to thread
> context. Despite the existence of different memory contexts in which a
> regular program can run, like kernel threads, or the process context
> in the user-space, from the scheduling viewpoint they are all threads.
> Linux has not one but five schedulers. When invoked, the set of
> schedulers are queried in a fixed order. The following schedulers are
> checked: (i) stop-machine, a pseudo-scheduler used to execute kernel
> facilities, (ii) SCHED\_DEADLINE \[[27](#_bookmark63)\], (iii) the
> fixed-priority real-time scheduler, (iv) the completely fair scheduler
> (CFS), (v) the IDLE scheduler. Every time the schedulers execute, the
> highest-priority thread is selected for a context switch. When no
> ready threads are available, the IDLE scheduler returns the *idle
> thread*, a particular thread always ready to
>
> run. For simplicity, we refer hereafter with the term *scheduler* when
> mentioning the kernel
>
> code handling all the scheduling operations related to all five
> schedulers. The scheduler
>
> is called either voluntarily by a thread leaving the processor, or
> involuntarily, to cause a preemption. Any currently executing thread
> can postpone the execution of the scheduler while running in the
> kernel context by either disabling preemption or the IRQs. It is a
> goal of the fully-preemptive kernel developers to reduce the amount of
> time in which sections of code can postpone the scheduler execution.

> Linux has an advanced set of tracing methods \[[28](#_bookmark65)\].
> An essential characteristic of the Linux tracing feature is its
> efficiency. Currently, the majority of Linux distributions have the
> tracing features enabled and ready to use. When disabled, the tracing
> methods have nearly zero overhead, thanks to the extensive usage of
> runtime code modifications. Currently, there are two main interfaces
> by which these features can be accessed from user-space: perf and
> ftrace. The most common action is to record the occurrence of events
> into a trace-buffer for post-processing or human interpretation of the
> events. Furthermore, it is possible to take actions based on events,
> such as to record a *stacktrace*. Moreover, tools can also hook to the
>
> trace methods, processing the events in many different ways, and also
> be leveraged for other
>
> purposes. For example, the Live Patching feature of Linux uses the
> function tracer to hook and deviate the execution of a problematic
> function to a revised version of the function that fixes a problem
> \[[32](#_bookmark69)\]. A similar approach was used for runtime
> verification of the Linux kernel, proving to be an efficient approach
> \[[18](#_bookmark55)\].

# Automata Models and the PREEMPT\_RT Synchronization Model

> An automaton is a well-known formal method, utilized in the modeling
> of *Discrete Event Systems* (DES). The evolution of a DES is described
> with all possible sequences of events *e*<sub>1</sub>*,
> e*<sub>2</sub>*, e*<sub>3</sub>*, ...e<sub>n</sub>*, with
> *e<sub>i</sub> âˆˆ E*, defining the language *L* that describes the
> system.
>
> Automata are characterized by a directed graph or state transition
> diagram representation. For example, consider the event set *E* =
> *{nmi*\_*entry, nmi*\_*exit}* and the state transition diagram in
> Figure [1](#_bookmark2), where nodes represent system states, labeled
> arcs represent transitions between states, the arrow points to the
> initial state, and the nodes with double circles are *marked states*,
> i.e., safe states of the system.
>
> Formally, a deterministic automaton, denoted by *G*, is a tuple *G* =
> *{X, E, f, x*<sub>0</sub>*, X<sub>m</sub>}*; where: *X* is the set of
> states; *E* is the set of events; *f* : *X Ã— E â†’ X* is the transition
> function, defining the state transition between states from *X* due to
> events from *E*; *x*<sub>0</sub> is the initial
>
> state and *X<sub>m</sub> âŠ† X* is the set of marked states.
>
> An important operation is the *parallel composition* of two or more
> automata that are combined to compose a single, augmented-state,
> automaton \[[7](#_bookmark44)\], enabling the model of complex systems
> using the modular approach. In the modular approach, the system is
> modeled as a set of two classes of automata: *generators* and
> *specifications*. Each sub-system has a *generator* of events modeled

# Basic Operations

> This section describes *generators* relevant for the scheduling
> latency analysis, starting with the interrupt behavior:
>
> **O1**: The NMI context starts with the entry of the NMI handler
> (nmi\_entry), and exits in the return of the handler (nmi\_exit). This
> operation is modeled as in Figure [1](#_bookmark2) (in Section
> [2](#background)).
>
> **O2**: Linux allows threads to temporarily mask interrupts
> (local\_irq\_disable), in such a way to avoid access to shared data in
> an inconsistent state. Threads need to unmask interrupts
> (local\_irq\_enable) at the end of the critical section, as modeled in
> Figure [2](#_bookmark4). **O3**: To enforce synchronization, the
> processor masks interrupts before calling an interrupt handler on it.
> IRQs stays masked during the entire execution of an interrupt handler
> (hw\_local\_irq\_disable). Interrupts are unmasked after the return of
> the handler (hw\_local\_irq\_enable), as shown in Figure
> [3](#_bookmark4). In the model, these events are used to identify the
> begin and the return of an IRQ execution.
>
> The reference model considers two threads: the thread under analysis
> and an arbitrary other thread (including the idle thread). The
> corresponding operations are discussed next.
>
> ![](./media/image3.png)**O4**: The thread is not running until its
> context is loaded in the processor (sched\_switch-
>
> \_in). The context of a thread can be unloaded by a suspension
> (sched\_switch\_suspend), blocking (sched\_switch\_blocking), or
> preemption (sched\_switch\_preempt), as in Fig- ure [4](#_bookmark4).
>
> **O5**: The model considers that there is always *another thread*
> ready to run. The reason is that, on Linux, the *idle state* is
> implemented as a thread, so at least the *idle thread* is ready to
> run. The other thread can have its context unloaded
> (sched\_switch\_out\_o) and loaded (sched\_switch\_in\_o) in the
> processor, as modeled in Figure [5](#_bookmark4).
>
> **O6**: The preemption is enabled by default. Although the same
> *function* is used to disable preemption, the model distinguishes the
> different reasons to disable preemption, as modeled in Figure
> [6](#_bookmark4). The preemption can be disabled either to postpone
> the scheduler execution (preempt\_disable), or to protect the
> scheduler execution of a recursive call
>
> (preempt\_disable\_sched). Hereafter, the latter mode is referred to
> as *preemption disabled to call the scheduler* or *preemption disabled
> to schedule*.
>
> **O7**: The scheduler starts to run selecting the highest-priority
> thread (schedule\_entry,
>
> in Figure [7](#_bookmark4)), and returns after scheduling
> (schedule\_exit).
>
> **O8**: Before being able to run, a thread needs to be awakened
> (sched\_waking). A thread can set its state to *sleepable*
> (sched\_set\_state\_sleepable) when in need of resources. This
> operation can be undone if the thread sets its state to runnable again
> (sched\_set\_state\_runnable). The automata that illustrates the
> interaction among these events is shown in Figure [8](#_bookmark4).
>
> **O9**: The set need re-schedule (sched\_need\_resched) notifies that
> the currently running thread is not the highest-priority anymore, and
> so the current CPU needs to re-schedule, in such way to select the new
> highest-priority thread (Figure [9](#_bookmark4)).

# Rules

> The *Thread Synchronization Model* \[[14](#_bookmark50)\] includes a
> set of *specifications* defining the synchro- nization rules among
> *generators* (i.e., the basic operations discussed in Section
> [3.1](#basic-operations)). Next, we summarize a subset of rules
> extracted from the automaton, which are relevant to analyze the
> scheduling latency. Each rule points to a related specification,
> graphically illustrated
>
> with a corresponding figure.
>
> **IRQ and NMI rules.** First, we start discussing rules related to
> IRQs and NMI.
>
> **R1**: There is no specification that blocks the execution of a NMI
> (**O1**) in the automaton. **R2**: There is a set of events that are
> not allowed in the NMI context (Figure [10](#_bookmark8)), including:
>
> **R2a**: set the need resched (**O9**).
>
> **R2b**: call the scheduler (**O7**).
>
> **R2c**: switch the thread context (**O4** and **O5**) **R2d**:
> enabling the preemption to schedule (**O6**).
>
> **R3**: There is a set of events that are not allowed in the IRQ
> context (Figure [11](#_bookmark8)), including:
>
> **R3a**: call the scheduler (**O7**).
>
> **R3b**: switch the thread context (**O4** and **O5**). **R3c**:
> enabling the preemption to schedule (**O6**).
>
> **R4**: IRQs are disabled either by threads (**O2**) or IRQs (**O3**),
> as in the model in Figure [12](#_bookmark8). Thus, it is possible to
> conclude that:
>
> **R4a**: by disabling IRQs, a thread postpones the begin of the IRQ
> handlers.
>
> **R4b**: when IRQs are not disabled by a thread, IRQs can run.
>
> **Thread context.** Next, synchronization rules related to the thread
> context are discussed. We start presenting the necessary conditions to
> call the scheduler (**O7**).

## Necessary conditions to call and run the scheduler.

> **R5**: The scheduler is called (and returns) with interrupts enabled
> (Figure [13](#_bookmark8)).
>
> **R6**: The scheduler is called (and returns) with preemption disabled
> to call the scheduler (i.e., via the preempt\_disable\_sched event,
> Figure [14](#_bookmark8)).
>
> **R7**: The preemption is never enabled by the scheduling context
> (Figure [15](#_bookmark8)). Regarding the context switch (**O4** and
> **O5**), the following conditions are required.

## Necessary conditions for a context switch.

> **R8**: The context switch occurs with interrupts disabled by threads
> (**O2**) and preemption disabled to schedule (**O6**, Figure
> [16](#_bookmark8)).
>
> **R9**: The context switch occurs in the scheduling context (**O7**,
> Figure [17](#_bookmark8))
>
> The necessary conditions to set the need resched (**O9**) and to
> wakeup a thread (**O8**) are the same. They are listed below, and show
> in Figure [18](#_bookmark8).

## Necessary conditions to set the need resched and to wakeup a thread.

> **R10** Preemption should be disabled, by any mean (**O6**).
>
> **R11** IRQs should be masked, either to avoid IRQ (**O2**) or to
> postpone IRQs (**O3**).
>
> Until here, we considered necessary conditions. From now on, we will
> present sufficient conditions.

## Sufficient conditions to call the scheduler and to cause a context switch.

> **R12** Disabling preemption to schedule (**O6**) always causes a call
> to the scheduler (**O7**, Figure [19](#_bookmark9)).
>
> **R13** Calling the scheduler (**O7**) always results in a context
> switch (**O4**,**O5**). Recall that if the system is idle, the idle
> thread is executed after the context switch. (Figure
> [20](#_bookmark9)). **R14** Setting need resched (**O9**) always
> results in a context switch (**O4**,**O5**, Figure
> [21](#_bookmark10)).

#  6 Experimental Analysis

> This section presents latency measurements, comparing the results
> found by cyclictest and perf rtsl while running concurrently in the
> same system. The main objective of this experimental study is to
> corroborate the practical applicability of the analysis tool. To this
> end, we show that the proposed approach provides latency bounds
> respecting the under millisecond requirement in scheduling precision
> (which is typical of applications using PREEMPT\_RT) for most of the
> proposed interrupt characterizations. The proposed perf rtsl tool
> individually characterizes the various sources of latency and composes
> them leveraging a theory-based approach allowing to find highly
> latency-intensive schedules in a much shorter time than cyclictest.
> The experiment was made in a workstation with one Intel *i7-6700K CPU
> @ 4.00GHz* processor, with eight cores, and in a server with two
>
> Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) Intel *Xeon L5640 CPU @ 2.27GHz*
> processors with
>
> six cores each. Both systems run the Fedora 31 Linux distribution,
> using the kernel-rt *5.2.21-rt14*. The systems were tuned according to
> the best practices of real-time Linux systems \[[34](#_bookmark71)\].
>
> The first experiment runs on the workstation three different workloads
> for 30 minutes. In the first case, the system is mostly *idle*. Then
> workloads were generated using two phoronix-test-suite (pts) tests:
> the openssl stress test, which is a *CPU intensive* workload, and the
> fio, stress-ng and build-linux-kernel tests together, causing a mixed
> range of *I/O intensive* workload \[[31](#_bookmark68)\]. Different
> columns are reported in each graph, corresponding to the different
> characterization of interrupts discussed in Section
> [5](#rt_sched_latency-efficient-scheduling-latency-estimation-tool-kit).
> The result of this experiment is shown in Figure [26](#_bookmark36):
> 1.a, 1.b and 1.c, respectively. In the second experiment, the *I/O
> intensive* workload was executed again, with different test durations,
> as described in 2.a, 2.b, and 2.c. The results from cyclictest did not
> change substantially as
>
> the time and workload changes. On the other hand, the proposed
> approach results change, increasing the hypothetical bounds as the
> kernel load and experiment duration increase. Consistently with
> cyclictest results, the *No Interrupts* column also do not vary
> substantially. The difference comes from the interrupt workload: the
> more overloaded the system is, and the longer the tests run, the more
> interrupts are generated and observed, influencing the
>
> results. In all the cases, the *sporadic task model* appears to be
> overly pessimistic for IRQs: regularly, the *oWCET* of IRQs were
> longer than the minimal observed inter-arrival time of them. The
> *Sliding Window with oWCET* also stand out the other results. The
> results are truncated in the charts 2.b and 2.c: their values are 467
> and 801 microseconds, respectively.

#  7 Conclusions and Future Work

> The usage of the *Thread Synchronization Model* \[[14](#_bookmark50)\]
> was a useful logical step between the real- time theory and Linux,
> facilitating the information exchange among the related, but
> intricate, domains. The analysis, built upon a set of
> practically-relevant variables, ends up concluding
>
> what is informally known: the preemption and IRQ disabled sections,
> along with interrupts, are the evil for the scheduling latency. The
> tangible benefits of the proposed technique come from the
> decomposition of the variables, and the efficient method for observing
> the values. Now users and developers have precise information
> regarding the sources of the latency on their systems, facilitating
> the tuning, and the definition of where to improve the Linux code,
> respectively. The improvement of the tool and its integration with the
> Linux kernel and perf code base is the practical continuation of this
> work.
